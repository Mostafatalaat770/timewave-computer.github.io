        <p>We believe that crypto has laid the foundation for permissionless digital institutions that enable humanity to collaborate with uprecedented scope and scale.</p>
        <p>Timewave architects such institutions to bring long term alignment across the interchain. We are currently researching, designing, and building the Interchain Allocator, which includes tooling for the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>effective resource allocation</li>
          <li>protocol-to-protocol dealmaking</li>
          <li>cooperation within and among DAOs</li>
          <li>MEV, governance, and liquid staking supply chains</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In our vision, all who endeavor to grow the interchain are limited only by their own imaginations and the laws of physics, not by tooling or resources.</p>
