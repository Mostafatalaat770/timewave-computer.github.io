## Sacred timekeepers of the interchain
We believe that crypto has laid the foundation for permissionless digital
institutions that enable humanity to collaborate with unprecedented scope and
scale.

Timewave architects such institutions to bring long-term alignment across the
interchain. We are currently researching, designing, and building the Interchain
Allocator, which includes tooling for the following:

- effective resource allocation
- protocol-to-protocol dealmaking
- cooperation within and among DAOs
- MEV, governance, and liquid staking supply chains

In our vision, all who endeavor to grow the interchain are limited only by their
own imaginations and the laws of physics, not by tooling or resources.
